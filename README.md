# Traffic-Sign-Classifier
Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Class Project, due on Jan 9th, 2017

# Project Specification
Dataset Exploration
* Perform a visulation on the dataset

Design and Test a Model Architecture
* Solution Design - Thoroughly discusses the approach taken for deriving and designing a model architecture fit for solving the problem given.
* Model Architecture - Provide sufficient details of the characteristics and qualities of the architecture, such as the type of model used, the number of layers, the size of each layer. 
* Preprocessing - Provide sufficient details of the preprocessing techniques used, and why the techniques were chosen.
* Dataset and Training - How the model was trained and evaluated. 

Test a Model on New Images
* Acquiring New Images - Choose five candidate image of traffic signs taken and visualizes them in the report.
* Performance on New Images - Documents the performance of the model when tested on the captured images and compares it to the results of testing on the dataset.
* Model Certainty Visualization - The softmax probabilities of the predictions on the captured images are visualized.
